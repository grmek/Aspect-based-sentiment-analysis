Authors: Miha Bizjak, Anže Gregorc, Rok Grmek

## What is this?
This is a project for the Natural language processing course (FRI UL 2019/2020).
Our task is to get the subjective information from text material that refer to a entity with the use of natural language processing and other methods.
A entity is considered as a person, organization or a location and can be represented multiple times in one document or a sentence and there could be more entities in one document.
All methods are evaluated on the [SentiCoref 1.0](https://www.clarin.si/repository/xmlui/handle/11356/1285) data set.

## How to run it?
